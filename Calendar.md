# Flaxean Calendar

The Flaxean calendar is based around two Moons, Lira and Ses, Lira marks the seasons while Ses marks months. Lira is new for three days marking the new season, waxes for 39 days, is full for another three days and wanes for 39 days, she does this four times a year marking Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Ses's cycle is less regular she waxes and wanes each for 12 days but is full for three days and new for one in the summer, new for three days and full for one in the winter and full and new for two days each in the spring and autumn.

The old year is said to end during the winter darkness, a period of three days at the beginning of winter when both moons are new, and the new year is considered to have begun three days later when both moons are waxing. This period is known as the Long Night for it is also the three days of the year when the days are shortest.

Long night - three days marking the time from one year ending and another beginning. This occurs between the 333rd day of the ending year and the first day of the new one.
