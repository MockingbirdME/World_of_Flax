# Flaxen Calendar

The Flaxen calendar is based around two Moons, Lira and Sess, Lira marks the seasons while Sess marks months. Lira is new for three days marking the new season, waxes for 39 days, is full for another three days and wanes for 39 days, she does this four times a year marking Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Sess's cycle is less regular she waxes and wanes each for 12 days but is full for three days and new for one in the summer, new for three days and full for one in the winter and full and new for two days each in the spring and autumn.

The old year is said to end during the winter darkness, a period of three days at the beginning of winter when both moons are new, and the new year is considered to have begun three days later when both moons are waxing. This period is known as the Long Night for it is also the three days of the year when the days are shortest.

### Common calendar breakdown and date description
While the Mablen do consider the number of days in a month, season, or year most only count the days in the quarter month, or span. Each month is therefor broken into six parts, the First Season's Even or Long Night, the Midseason's Day(s) and four spans commonly called first crescent, first and second gibbous, and second crescent in that order.

Dates are often spoken of as which day of which span in what number month of which season, such as "meet me on the third day of spring's second waxing gibbous" or "when Sess is full for the last time this winter."

### Important times of year
Long Night - three days marking the time from one year ending and another beginning. This occurs between the 333rd day of the ending year and the first day of the new one. The beginning of the Long Night is also the beginning of the winter season. The Long Night is a time where no one who cares about their life will venture outside of their town or city, and many refuse to leave the safety of their own homes. It is said that the Long Night is when sorcerers and witches cast their dark rituals and the creatures from The Deadlands roam all of Flax.

First Springs/Summers/Autumns Eve - each season begins with both moons being new marking one to two nights with no illumination but starlight. These nights are generally nights where friends and families gather to feast and celebrate the coming season, the are just as importantly nights were nearly everyone stays in doors as like with the Long Night creatures of The Deadands are said to be able to to leave its boarders.

Mid Season Days - these days where both moons are full keep the nights lit almost as well as the days, they are a time for celebration, fairs, tourneys, and festivals alike.

### Terms of history and the passing of time:
* The Nows - the time of first creation when Zenies created Projo, The Seer, and his twin Yeast, who is also The Seer.
* The Hours - the time of the second creation, when the Ohma and the Dwellers were created and Flax first came into being.  
* The Days - the time of the third, and final, creation, when Flax was populated with plants and animals and the Strains came into being.
* The Eras - with the Mablen creation of the calendar time began to be measured by the strains and was no longer understood solely by the gods.
* The First Era - the time of discovery, the Mablen claim the first era lasted five thousand years; during this time the Strains spread and met and built early communities and fought bloody wars over land and resources. No true civilizations existed during this time.
* The Second Era - the time of kings, as small communities gained more power and minor warlords seised land hundreds of small kingdoms emerged, few lasting more than a generation. The second era is said to have lasted 2 thousand years and come to an end with the creation of the, then small, kingdom of Grail.
* The Third Era - the time of civilization, starting with the founding of the kingdom of grail and ending with it's fracture. This Era lasted nearly a thousand years.
* The Fourth Era - an unnamed time, barely 200 years in and with no single great defining feature the forth era is still young and it's legacy yet unknown.
