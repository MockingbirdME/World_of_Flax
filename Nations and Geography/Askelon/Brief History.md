# History of Askelon

### Founding
Askel was once in the middle of The Disputed Lands, constantly warred over by Sapeen warlords and Teejee complexes, only one generation strong. This came to an end when the warlord Solomide, and a newly unbound Teejee queen struck an alliance. They shared their blood in a ritual no longer remembered that forever bound their lines.

Solomide's tribe united with the queen's complex warred against the other tribes and complexes populating the Isles of Askel conquering one island after another until all were ruled by this one alliance. Solomide then crowed himself king of the Isles of Askel with the Teejee queen as his partner in the first Royal Union of the new nation of Askelon.

### The Principalities
Solomide's descendants were not content to rule Askel's Isles they waged war after war with the tribes and complexes of the mainland. Each time they gained a foothold in what would become Askelon's five principalities the current queen would assign one of her daughters to manage a new complex allied with the Sapeen prince assigned to govern this area all beholden to the Royal Union ruling the Isles.

Year after year and generation after generation these principalities expanded further into the Disputed Lands paying for each acre taken with the blood of Askelonian soldiers. As the principalities expanded beyond what one prince could effectively govern on their own they in turn broke up their land and placed individual dukes and barons to govern it.

### Internal Conflict
The principalities where forbidden from taking land outside of their designated river boarders but this did not always stop wars between principalities over resources or honor. In similar fashion the dukes and barons often fought short wars with each other over territory or resources. These conflicts proved so uncontrollable that rather than trying to stop them rules were put in place to limit the damage they could do; these rules include how a war is to be stopped as well as putting prices on the heads of captured soldiers that must be paid by the Royal Union or prince if the warring party is unable to, all designed to limit the cost in life of Askelonian citizens and civilians.

### Continued Expansion
The southern principalities expanded to the great marshes in less than 100 years after their founding, stopping their expansion. The north eastern principality continued to expand until the arrival of the Centari with whom an agreement on where their boarder would be was eventually made. The principalities to the west could only expand so far before they found themselves contesting with the frontier settlements of Grail, these principalities eventually took over many of these settlements after Grails fall.
