# The Royal Union
Ruling from the very top of Askelons power structure is the Royal Union, one Sapeen king descended from Solomide, Askelon's first King, and one Teejee queen matriarch of the entire Teejee complex residing in the nation. The Royal Union has absolute control over the Askelonian Isles and the princes and princesses of the Askelonian Principalities swear fealty to them.

When a king dies or retires their council of stewards rules in their place for three months after which time an election takes place in the capital where any adult descendent of Solomide may be put forward as a candidate and candidates are voted upon by all citizens present for the event; one vote is taken each day until a single candidate receives a majority of the votes and the backing of the council of stewards or a 2/3rds majority vote without the council's backing. It's common for a king to retire and use their influence to back a particular candidate to be the next king. Kings are generally addressed as 'Lord or Lady King' and more informally 'my King' or 'Highness.'

Teejee Queens are not chosen so democratically, the queen always has a single living queen daughter, she kills the rest, when the queen dies her daughter who is the mother of all five princesses calls her daughters to her murdering 4 of them, the remaining daughter is then tasked with choosing 5 of her queen daughters to place the now vacant princess positions.

# The Five Princes
Princes are chosen much like kings but from amongst the lords and ladies of the principality, they are not required to be descended from Solomide or even Sapeen though they generally are. Princes swear fealty to the king and are sworn fealty by the barons and dukes of their principality. Princes are formally referred to as 'Lord or Lady Prince' and informally as 'Prince', 'Lord or Lady' or 'my Prince.'

# Duchies and baronies
The high lords and ladies of Askelon rule over provinces within a principality. These titles are based largely on the power and wealth of the territory but don't change once assigned so while a Duke or Duchess usually has more power than a Baron or Baroness this is not always the case. All high lords swear fealty to their prince and are in turn sworn fealty by the landowners who rule within their domains. Dukes and Barons are referred to as 'Lord or Lady' or 'My duke, duchess, baron, baroness.'

# Counts and Countesses
Not all Askelonian lords and ladies control territories, some are close advisors to kings or princes, others are highly successful merchants, guild leaders, mages or the like. Their place amongst other lords is not always clear but a count or countess would generally be considered to outrank a landowner and be outranked by a prince, with their individual status determining how they're treated compared to, or by, dukes and barons. 

# Landowners
The lowest class of Lords and Ladies, landowners control smaller territories and swear fealty to a Duke or Baron. They are lords and ladies in their own right but traditionally referred to as 'Master or Mistress' and sometimes 'Sire.'

# Citizens
Askelonian citizens are individuals authorized to own land and businesses as well as to vote in the elections of Kings and local Princes. Citizenship is not inherited but rather must be either procured with proof of ability and means to own workable land or other business, or have been granted it along with a boon by a Duke, Baron, Prince, or King. This boon must be at least valuable enough that it could be used as proof of ability to be a citizen by an applicant. Citizens are taxed much more highly than the unbound but have many more privileges as well.

# Unbound
Locals who are neither Askelonian citizens nor are they bound to work for one. Unbound may work in most any capacity they wish but may not own land or businesses and are restricted in their ability to own, purchase or sell restricted materials like steel or essence.

# Bound
Most individuals in Askelon are bound to service, working for a citizen or lord. An individual submits to bondage for a period of one year at a time in exchange for a set payment, room and board. An individual choosing to leave their bondage or whose master refuses to take them back on after their year has expired becomes Unbound until they've found a new master. Children of a bound individual are to be cared for by their master, including room and board, education or training; this training may include work serving in the house or as an apprentice to a skilled worker for up to half the day but they may not be put to hard labor.

# Bound and Unbound Teejee
The terminology for non-citizen Askelonians gets a little fuzzy when it comes to non-queen Teejee females. All Teejee are bound to their mothers or other queens but when female's controlling queen dies when they are far enough from another close queen relation so as not to be dominated by them they can become unbound Teejee, no longer controlled by a queen. These Teejee may be unbound in relation to a queen but can still choose to enter bondage with an Askelonian Lord or Lady.
