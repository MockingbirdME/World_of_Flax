The Beginning

In the first of Nows there existed Zenies, The Stasis, who then was also The Nothing. The Stasis, so distraught by its own failings, willed into being Projo, The Seer. In the moment that the Seer was born he split in two; The Seer’s compliment, and twin, is called Yeast, The Rememberer, who is also The Seer.

Zenies, the Static One, found himself caught always between the Twins so that he would gaze upon Projo when looking forward and upon Yeast when looking behind. It was with this First of Trinities that the Nows became the Hours.

In the First Hour Projo, He who Envisions, spoke with his brother of their parent, the Nothing’s, many lackings. Yeast’s parent, He who Exists, upon hearing his children speak became unhappy with his formlessness. It was thus, in the First Hours, that Zenies performed his second act of will and The Nothing fragmented becoming many.

It was then, at the end of the First Hours, that within Zenies, The Scattered, were born the first daughters: Flax, she of substance; Solma, she who illuminates; and Kin, the Forces.

In the Second Hours after the birth of the Twins Flax, the Great Nurturer, who was then lonely asked of her younger sister to bring her closer to their middle sibling, who was then the favorite of Zenies. From these Hours hence all daughters of Flax would seek to be near the daughters of Solma, though they would find themselves in constant competition with Zenies for the attention of Solma and her daughters, for he too seeks to bask in her attention.

To mark the beginning of the Third Hours jealous Zenies, Parent of all and Nothing, created for himself another son who he cast upon his eldest daughter to blanket her from the Rays of Solma’s affection. This son who is called The Cleanser did as his father bade him. Upon seeing this Kin, Mover of all things, who had no love for her parent, the Stasis, but much love for her sisters, gave birth to a daughter of her own whom she named Shiver, the Northern Wind. Shiver, who had some compassion for The Parent could not bring herself to completely separate her uncle, The Cleanser, from Flax but chose instead to scatter him and blow him about so that sometimes Flax would receive Solm’s love and other times The Cleanser, who is called Clurses, would hold the sisters apart.

Despite the aid she received from Breeze, her niece, Flax’s anger continued to grow as she felt that her parent, Zenies, had shunned her in the competition for Solma’s attention. This anger continued to build until, as the Fourth Hours were dawning, Flax erupted with anger, an act that would forever change her face from something smooth and solid into a many faceted and fractured appearance with many textures and blemishes. In response to Flax’s anguish her sister, Solma, unleashed a declaration of affection so moving that it caused Clurses to weep; in his weeping Clurses, the Father, spilled life upon Flax: in her deepest wounds he sent his son Levith to fill her, the rest of Flax’s face was divided by Levith’s twins Seva and YajGul and together they covered, and filled, Flax with life. Even barren Shiver was unable to keep Clurses’s tears completely out of the North, where she resided. It was then in the Fourth Hours that Flax became filled with life.

In the Fifth Hours those who resided on Flax: Clurses, Shiver, Levith, Seva, and YojGul of whom Clurses and Shiver are the eldest, began to multiply until there were many. All of this made Flax pleased, which eased the tension among those who are older than the Dwellers, who are known as the Oma or Omas of whom Zennies was the first.

Towards the end of the Fifth Hours Projo, who sees, and his twin, who remembers, saw all that had passed since they came from Nothing, The Parent, and saw too that the Hours where at an end. The Twins created for themselves a sister to complete their group; the sister they named Hour, The Keeper, and with the appearance of Hour the Hours came to an end and thus began the Days.


The First Days

In the beginning of the First Days the Dwellers who had by that time taken up domains upon Flax had ceased to multiply and now numbered as many. Though they were many the Dwellers were often lonely in their domains. This loneliness is what lead _____ of those who reside upon Flax to create lesser beings for company, beings that would be ranked somewhere between the life that populated Flax and the Dwellers themselves; these beings would become collectively known as The Strains.

The first and eldest of the strains are the Mablen, children of Igno who’s domain is in the quarries. The Mablen were created with the wisdom of ages so that they may Sheppard the strains who were to come after them. Igno, who often changes but never ceases, created his children so that their name never leave Hour’s tome. The Mablen’s creation also instilled music into Flax’s ears as their voices resonate with all creatures: Strains, Dwellers, and Oma alike. The Mablen numbered in the few but those few held resolve enough for them to have been legion. And so the Mablen went forth to obtain understanding of the many domains of Flax and in search of younger strains so that they may guide them in the ways of Igno.

Second born of the strains were the children of Abef, who possessed great love of Flax’s cliffs and many peaks. Abef taught his children, who are called Gusten, to take pleasure in the smallest of things so that even the barren peaks might bring great joy. The Gusti thrived under Abef’s guidance and expanded to peaks across the face of Flax during the First Days.

Milnot, the mountain mistress, created her children on the mountain side. She taught them to be strong and independent and full of pride. Milnot’s children were raised also by Shimmer, the Changeling, who taught them how to grow to their own liking rather than to follow a preset course. Each of these children prospered and together became known as the Torlen. The Torlen proliferated slowly and so did not greatly expand their lands during these First of Days.

At about the same time that Pattern and Milnoght were shaping the first Torlini, Siyon, of the swamps, and his Twin Eightoo, Lady of the Wood, decided that they too ought to create a Strain so as they may honor Flax. Rather than working together, as Milnoght and Pattern had done, these twins choose to compete in their creations. Siyon created the Garjants, those who always grow, to rule over her bogs with great strength and ferocity. The Wood’s Mistress chose a different root than her twin; she created smaller creatures capable of great mobility of body and wit. It was Eghtoos children, the Denja, who were the first strain to be found by the Mablen; it was the Denja to first create a structured society. Despite the great differences in these two strains they have from their beginning thought of each other as brothers.

Tern, he who is Soil, his friend Free, the Jokester, and Free’s Sibling, Bodeen the Laborer, sought together to create a Strain who would be superior to all others, a Strain that would be a model for all others to follow. Their children became of three varieties, each primarily influenced by one of their creators, the Lawgiver, the Imbiber, and the Worker. Collectively called Teejees, this Strain who was the last to come in the First of Days, established and expansive empire beneath the surface of Flax, hidden from the other Strains, before most of the strains had yet to develop civilization.

In what remained of the First Days the Strains born in that time, called the Ancients, proliferated and spread further over Flax, the Nurturer. It was then that Hour’s book first had a name erased so that only Yest remembered it; this erasure marked the end of the First Days.


The Second Days

Upon seeing the beauty of the Strains, Clurses, the ambitious, decided that he too would create a strain to spread across Flax. He recognized the various limitations of the other Strains and striving to out do the younger Dwellers he created Sapiens, tamer of beasts, who are often known as the Adaptive. The Sapiens quickly spread out over the face of Flax and took many different roles in many different climates. Sapiens were everything Clurses wanted; they could survive just about anywhere, they could adapt to new situations quickly and with the guidance of the Mablen they were fast to create tribal society structures.

Up until this point there had been little conflict between the Strains of Flax. The first battle to be fought upon Flax was between the Sapiens and the Teejee. The Sapiens, unaware of the underground complexes of the Teejee, began to collect food from the fields that a group of Teejee had planted. The field did not produce a large enough harvest to feed both the Sapien tribe and the Teejee complex. The Teejee’s struck first, killing most of the Sapien gatherers. At that time the Sapiens did not know warfare but the name Inventors is justly given to them as they quickly developed methods of fending off the Teejee. War soon raged between the two groups for many months before a lost Denja learned of the situation and brought to two groups together for mediation. This first war lasted but a few months but with the first blood spilled the Strains would never cease warring with each other.

Shiver, the Northern wind, seeing all the various Strains expanding over Flaxe feared that her mountains, which separated her northern home from the lands of the Strains, would soon become homes, or worse still battlegrounds, for these younger creatures. Shiver decided that she would create guardians for her mountains. She brought forth thirteen great blocks of ice and carved from them the first Rhosk. She taught her children the secrets of stone and ice; with these secrets it came to pass that her proud children became the first builders; they created great towers and fortresses on their mother’s mountains.

At the same time that Shiver created her guardians Ancon, Vine Queen, too became nervous of the many Strains now wondering Flaxe. Ancon knew it was unlikely that many of these Strains would wish to inhabit her dangerous jungles but she recognized the possibility that her beautiful gardens would be burned by members of the Strains who wished to live safely in the area her lands now covered. Following Shiver’s example Ancon too created protectors for her domain. It was the last act of the Second Days when ancon breathed life into the Kaazt, who would be the last of the Strains to draw breath upon Flaxe.


The Third Days

	The Mablen
In the beginning the Mablen had wished to shepherd the younger Strains so that all may live in harmony. With the first violence of the Second Days and the subsequent creation of the Rhosks and the Kaazt the Mablen realized that the other Strains would not follow them; and so the Mablen contented themselves with watching and remembering the acts of their shorter lived brethren.

In the Third Hours of the Third Days many Mablen journeyed to the land they called home and that is now known as the Great Quarry. It is here that the eldest Mablen Congregated to share stories of the younger Strains. As a necessity of the many tales and the uncertainty of time it was here to that the first calendar was made; and thus it was in the time of the founding of the Great Quarry that became the first cycle of the first era, and from that date only the Oma thought of time in terms of The Hours and The Days rather than the days and the seasons and the cycles and eras as those who dwell upon Flax now count time.

	The Gusten
By the beginning of the Third Days the Gusten had spread across Flax so that all of her peaks south of the great mountains of Shiver had become habited by the Gusten.

The Gusten who inhabited the taller mountains found food scarce. Abef, who loved her children, blessed those in the tallest mountains with quickness of food, smaller size, and longer pointed beaks so that they may more efficiently hunt the small animals of the underbrush for food rather than relying on the nuts and berries that other Gusten dine upon.

Not wanting to favor any of his children more than the others, Abef gifted his children who dwelt in friendlier hills with great intellect. He did this so that they may spend the time they save not having to hunt thinking on ways to improve their environment for their children.

	The Torleni
The Torleni proliferated slowly during the Third Days for they concerned themselves more with the art of she who raised them than with multiplying; this was all the easier because Shimmer continued to dwell among them as one of them rather than watch over her children as most of the Dwellers did in the Third Days.

Because Shimmer lived with the Torleni as a peer as well as a teacher, and too because during the Third Days the Torleni had not expanded past the place they were born, known now as Mount Milomb, it was the Torleni, of all the Strains, to first have the blood of the Dwellers flow in their veins. By the end of the Third Days it was rare indeed to encounter a Torleni without the blessing of Shimmer.

Those who do not share Shimmers blood can be traced to their Matriach, Tuice and her daughters. Tuice, the pure, was shunned by the other Matriarchs and so took her brood from the sides of Milomb and took up residence to the west in The Trail of Eyes.

	The Garjants
The Bredth Bogs, where the Garjants were born, filled with its children, who divided her into territories. The Garjants ruled over each other through strength alone. As the bogs filled the younger and weaker tribes were forced out and had to venture forth in search of new homes.

The Garjants, much to the approval of Siyon, battled with each other fiercely for the best hunting territories, thus always ensuring that the strongest thrived. It was in these days that six of those children of Siyon who controlled the greatest territories were blessed by Siyon and became the Bog Kings.

It was when Clurses, the protector, saw the Garjants, fiercest by far of the Strains, were venturing beyond the Bredth Bogs that he became fearful for his children and bestowed upon the Garjants who ventured beyond their ancestral lands the Nutrient Curse.

The curse, which effectively limited the Garjants population outside of the Bredth Bogs, is the basis for the hatred shared by Clurses and Siyon. Siyon, who is unable to forgive, has never stopped poisoning Clurses’s skies sense the curse was laid upon Siyon’s children. In retaliation Clurses has never stopped trying to flood Siyon’s bogs.

	The Teejees
The empire builders, youngest of the ancients, were born with such structure it is unsurprising that they expanded in an organized fashion. The Teejee were centrally led at that time by the first female; who as her realm expanded gifted territory to her daughters as a conquering king might do to his nobles.

The expansion was possible only through the combine work of the three genders of Teejee. The females ruled and gave tasks to the fun loving males who in turn led the hardworking drones. This allowed the most intelligent to focus on the over all workings of the empire while the most creative were able to go forth and enjoy their tasks by completing them in what way they deemed best, and the drones, who were designed for nothing but labor, were able to fulfill their purpose at the direction of the males.

This empire stretched far and deep but by design of the first female had very few tunnels leading to the surface of Flax where the Teejee might encounter other Strains.
